    <h1>Narwhals Research</h1>

    <p>Narwhals are medium-sized toothed whales that possess a large "tusk" from a protruding canine tooth. They live year-round in the Arctic waters around Greenland, Canada, and Russia.</p>

    <h2>Our Research</h2>
    <p>Our team conducts extensive research on narwhal migration patterns, communication methods, and population dynamics. We use state-of-the-art tracking technology to monitor their movements through Arctic waters.</p>

    <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
    <p>Narwhals face increasing threats from climate change and human activities. Our conservation efforts focus on protecting critical habitat areas and advocating for sustainable practices in Arctic regions.</p>
